## 1. Introduction
- Sliding Window is a method used to effiently solve pro lems that involve defining a fixed window or range in
the input data and then moving that window across the data to perform some operation within the window.
- The window is usually a subarray of the input data and is defined by two indices, usually the start and end indices.
- The window is slid across the input data by incrementing the start and end indices.
- The technique is commonly used in algorithms like finding subarrays with sum, finding the longest substring with
unique characters, or solving problems that require a fixed-size window to process elements efficiently.
